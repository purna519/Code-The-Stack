CSS POSITIONING
=================
CSS Positioning is used to control how elements are placed on a web page.

There are 5 types of CSS position values:

static
relative
absolute
fixed
sticky

POSITION: STATIC
-------------------
This is the default value.

Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

top, left, right, bottom do not have any effect.

Example behavior:
A <div> with position: static and top: 100px will ignore the top value.

POSITION: RELATIVE
--------------------
Element is positioned relative to its normal position.

It remains in the document flow, but can be moved using top, left, right, or bottom.

Other elements still behave as if the element is in its original position.

Example behavior:
If you set top: 50px, the element moves down by 50px, but the space it originally occupied remains.

POSITION: ABSOLUTE
--------------------
The element is removed from the normal document flow.

It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).

If no such ancestor is found, it is positioned relative to the <html> or viewport.

You can use top, right, bottom, left to position it.

Important:
To make an absolutely positioned element align relative to a section or container, that container must have position: relative.

POSITION: FIXED
------------------
The element is removed from the normal document flow.

It is positioned relative to the browser window (viewport).

It stays fixed at that position even when the user scrolls.

Common use: sticky headers, floating chat buttons, etc.

Example behavior:
A fixed nav bar at the top of the page remains visible when scrolling.

POSITION: STICKY
------------------
The element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the user's scroll position.

It behaves like relative until it reaches a defined scroll position, then sticks like fixed.

You must specify top, left, etc., for it to work.

Works best within scrollable containers.

Example behavior:
A sticky heading will scroll normally until it reaches the top of the screen, where it will stick.

Note:
position: sticky does not work if the parent element has overflow: hidden.

USE CASES:
-------------

static: Default behavior. Use when no positioning is needed.
relative: Slightly move element while maintaining flow.
absolute: Overlay elements, tooltips, dropdowns, etc.
fixed: Headers, footers, floating buttons.
sticky: Smart sticky headers, labels in scrollable content.
