Tables in HTML:

Purpose of Tables:

Tables are used to display data in a structured format using rows and columns.
Useful for organizing related information clearly, such as schedules, lists, or comparisons.

Basic Table Tags:
<table> : Defines the table container.
<tr> : Defines a table row.
<th> : Defines a table header cell, usually bold and centered.
<td> : Defines a table data cell, contains normal content.

Structure of a Table:
A table consists of multiple rows (<tr>) and each row contains header cells (<th>) or data cells (<td>).
The first row often contains header cells to describe the content of each column.

Important Attributes and Concepts:

border (attribute or CSS) : Adds borders to table and cells.
colspan and rowspan : Merge cells across columns or rows (used for complex tables).
Tables should be styled with CSS for better appearance.

Styling Tables:
Use CSS properties like border-collapse, padding, background-color to improve table readability.
Alternate row colors can improve visual clarity.
